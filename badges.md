# Badges

What are badges?

Badges are indicators on cards describing the type of action that is allowed to happen.  The team should aggree on the cards badge before the card is played.
If not the Standard should be assumed.

## Standard

All cards are standard cards unless a badge has been deliberatley included on the card.  The default standard behaviour is to do only what is neccasary. 
The simplest thing to achieve the goal.  This is a surgical intervention.

## Nuclear Option

This badge indicates that this card is most likley going to be a full rewrite of the system the card is about.  The system will have to be investigated and
a report given back to the team before an actual rewrite took place.  The team should expect this card to extend over sprints depending on what is involved BUT 
regular updates must be made.

## Wild

This badge falls between Nuclear and Standard.  By choosing this badge the team expects and ackowledges this card will invole a lot of investigation and will take 
more time and may only result in a series of cards being written.  Any solution that comes from a wild card is probably going to be neccasarily more complcated but 
it is still a surgical intervention.
