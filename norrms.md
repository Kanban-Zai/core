## WHAT ARE TEAM NORMS?

These direct the day to day behaviour of your team.  They will likely be different for each and every team, although there could be common themes.

* Team norms as decided on by the team and changed via a deviation.  
* They define the operational boundaries of team culture ( no need for HR )
* New people coming in should be familiarised with them
* they should be splattered all over the walls so they can be pointed at by anyone at any time.  
* Overtime they define the team culture.

## EXTENDING KANBAN-ZAI

Team Norms are your path to making Kanban-Zai fit your team, and even change with the team and the times.

Here are a few that you can adopt when you first begin with Kanban-Zai.  Longer term they may not fit, but in the beginning they will help alot.

#### BACKPORTING
In many cases cards are generally estimates (guesses) of what needs to be done.  You just dont know what you dont know sometimes.
However during the course of the work you may drop something, add something or change someting about the card.  Record this change, split out new cards
or combine existing ones.  The goal of backporting is for the card to represent what was done rather than what was asked for.

#### DEFINITION OF DONE
Once you start work on something it is very easy to endlessly tinker.  There needs to be an objective definition of when and why to stop.

#### SPEED LIMIT
Limit the amount of work in play at any one time.  It is to easy to get caught up in just pumping out work.  By taking some time out you can save time in the future.

#### T-SHIRT SIZING
Approximate the size of each chunk of work, it helps long term.

#### BOY-SCOUT
Essentially boy scouting is clearing technical debt as a regular practice which anyone can do all the time.  This is actually more dangerous and expensive than it sounds.

#### COWBOY
Under this setting members of the team are working fast and loose and generally leaving a wake of technical debt and everyone is ok with it.  This is a good way
to start a project sometimes.  Ultimatley though the tech debt is going to weigh you down, but it stretches the costing model out months or years.

#### AMORTIZE
Leave as little tech debt as possible and record what you do leave.  The team can reguarly choose to clear up some tech tebt OR leave it until new work comes along
and it is removed.  This is a balance between Boy-Scout and Cowboy.

#### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
This is a very formal seting which requires all developers tho be disciplined.  It adds technical debt in the form of tests and in the form of code depending on your settings. How this is implemented will have a very big impact on your team.


## Summary
Obviously this is going to require some negotiation with the team do keep your changes visible and get consensus.
