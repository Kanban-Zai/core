WHAT ARE TEAM NORMS?

These direct the day to day behaviour of your team.  They will likeley be different for each and every team, although there could be common themes.

EXTENDING KANBAN-ZAI

Team Norms are your path to making Kanban-Zai fit your team, and even change with the team and the times.

Here are a few that your can adopt when you first begin with Kanban-Zai.  Longer term they may not fit, but in the beginning they will help alot.

BACKPORTING - In some cases cards are generally estimates (guesses) of what needs to be done.  You just dont know what you dont know sometimes.
However during the course of the work you may drop something, add something or change someting about the card.  Record this change, split out new cards
or combine existing ones.  The goal of backporting is for the card to represent what was done rather than what was asked for.

Obviously this is going to require some negotiation with the team do keep your changes visible and get consensus.
