## WHAT ARE TEAM NORMS?

These direct the day to day behaviour of your team.  They will likely be different for each and every team, although there could be common themes.

## EXTENDING KANBAN-ZAI

Team Norms are your path to making Kanban-Zai fit your team, and even change with the team and the times.

Here are a few that you can adopt when you first begin with Kanban-Zai.  Longer term they may not fit, but in the beginning they will help alot.

BACKPORTING - In some cases cards are generally estimates (guesses) of what needs to be done.  You just dont know what you dont know sometimes.
However during the course of the work you may drop something, add something or change someting about the card.  Record this change, split out new cards
or combine existing ones.  The goal of backporting is for the card to represent what was done rather than what was asked for.

DEFINITION OF DONE - Once you start work on something it is very easy to endlessly tinker.  There needs to be an objective definition of when and why to stop.

SPEED LIMIT - Limit the amount of work in play at any one time.  It is to easy to get caught up in just pumping out work.  By taking some time out you can save time in the future.

T-SHIRT SIZING - Approximate the size of each chunk of work, it helps long term.

BOY-SCOUTING - The team grants the permission, under a flag, to go through the codebase and actively find, in the opinion of the boy scout, problems and fix them. The flag must be visually raised on the board and have generally accepted constraints by way of time and scope.  This is a great idea when the team is in danger of dying from death by a thousand cuts as to many very small cards can pointlessly overwhelm and detract from the end goal.  This is a break from normal process so there needs to be a reconcillation at the close of the card.  The boy scout must inform the team of changes made and the team must generally accept them good or bad.  Why bad?  Because this is not planned work, its search and destroy type stuff, some things may go wrong and have to be cleaned up.  Remember to set time and scope constraints to pre-mitigate some of the damage.  Also remember that boy scouts can be annoying so only raise this flag with a majority consenus.

## Summary
Obviously this is going to require some negotiation with the team do keep your changes visible and get consensus.
