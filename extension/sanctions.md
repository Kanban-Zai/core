# Sanctions

A sanction is merely a record of if the team felt a person should be.  It is not
an indicator of punishment it just represents when a team member, for any reason,
deviated fro mteh restrictions of Kanban-Zai.  All team members past and present 
must be recorded.

I should never be recorded in here why a team member is working for you currently
or no longer working for you.
