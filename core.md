## WHAT IS KANBAN-ZAI
Kanban-Zai is a social contract between all stake holders

## WHY KANBAN-ZAI

If you want to build scalable teams that are local or remote and enhance productivity and genuinely enrich the 
lives of everybody involved then Kanban-Zai is for you.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

* CONSENSUS   - Ensure everyone is one the same page.
* TRUST       - Which must be nurtured by stakeholders.
* FEEDBACK    - everyone needs it.  ALL the time. 
* DISCIPLINE  - Every one in the team must follow the collaborative process
* DEVIATIONS  - The one and only meeting Kanban-Zai enforces.  Run monthly, unless there is 100% consensus against it.

## GETTING STARTED

It is probably not worth implementing any form of management process if you are 3 or less in a team, but if your team 
has outside influences in any form it's probably worth considering.

There are some core immutable principles your team need to take on-board, without which you are not doing Kanban-Zai.

  * VISIBILITY  - this is an important factor in trust, consenus and feedback.  However you communicate, what needs to 
                  be achieved should be visible to all team members.  There should be one source of truth for the work 
                  ahead.  This means no personal task lists.
  * OBJECTIVITY - Personal opinion does not matter.  A consensus of opinions does.
  * EVIDENCE    - There should be evidence compelling the team to start a peice of work and evidence to compel the team
                  to cease that peice of work.
  * PRIORITY    - All things can be done as long as they are prioritized.  When deadlines are required priority defines
                  what is descoped.
  * CONSISTENCY - 
  * RESPECT -
  * TEAM NORMS  - Your team's standard operational settings.

## CULTURE

It is important to create a work environment where those who want to grow, and are prepared to commit to it, are able 
to do so.  To that end there is no assumption of what the culture in any given team should or will be.  There are 
guidelines on how a teams culture can avoid colliding with the core principles of Kanban-Zai

* reinforce reliability as a cultural value, most reliability issues between people can be boiled down to poor 
  communication, which is easily fixed
* Be ok with failure, do it often
* Be proactive about genuinley and generously giving credit to others
* Don't let blame blind you
* Don't wait to share bad news or ask for help
* Don't surprise people with decisions or problems out of the blue
* Don't surprise people, full stop.

## THE PROCESS

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  Conceptually there the larger team is separate into 3 teams.

* Vision team
* Planning Team
* Execution Team

### The Vision Team
Primarily comprises of the Client, End Users, Product Owner

As the saying goes.  The feet walk where the eyes lead.  It does not work that well the other
way around.  It also does not work that well when the feet both walk and lead.

The vision team must have a clear view of what they want.

### The Planning Team
Primarily comprised of the product owner, Design, UX, IA, BA, Testers, Security Advisor

Another saying goes the best laid plans of mice and men...refering to how plans can go wrong
But you actually have to have a plan.  Thats where this team comes in.

### The Execution Team
Primarily comprised of developers, testers, dev ops, security advisors.

There is no measure of velocity in Kanban-Zai. The execution team takes work from the 
backlog in sprint sized chunks.  Only work that can be achieved in 1 sprint should be taken.
Long running cards should be avoided at all costs.

When starting, the first sprint, out the team should take only a small amount of work
and leave most of the sprint for planning the next weeks work.

For the second sprint, take a bit more wok on and repeat the process.

repeat this process until you fail to complete a card.  Then dial it back a bit for the next 
sprint.

If you do fail to complete a card in the expected timeframe.  Thats ok.  But you need to know
why and make a plan to complete it next sprint.  Splitting or descoping where necessacry.


## DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Dont do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve 
everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective in the agile sense.  But, for example, a deviation allows you to 
introduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospectively.
