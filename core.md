WHAT IS KANBAN-ZAI

Kanban-Zai is a modern, people centric, flexible and extendable methodology for Software Development teams.  
A particular way of working is not enforced and the group of people involved are all encouraged to participate in extending your teams own subjective manifestation. 
The eventual manifestation, of KANBAN-ZAI will depend heavily on your teams collective interpretation of the following allegory.

“If Henry Ford listened to what his customers actually wanted we would all be driving around in 150 horsepower cars powered by 150 actual horses, and carbon emissions would be through the roof!”

## CORE IDEA

* CONSENSUS   - Ensure everyone is one the same page.
* TRUST       - Which must be nurtured by stakeholders.
* FEEDBACK    - everyone needs it.  ALL the time. 
* TEAM NORMS  - Your team's standard operational settings.
* DEVIATIONS  - The one and only meeting Kanban-Zai enforces.  Irregularly.  Use this to modify your settings.

There is only one rule.  Do not deviate from these ideas.  If you do you can no longer be considered to be practicing Kanban-Zai.

GETTING STARTED

Every Kanban-Zai team starts with the same default settings IE: none.  Run with them for a bit.   
If it works for you great.  
If it doesn't run a "Deviation"


THE PROCESS

Kanban-Zai is a hybrid collaboration between hardware and wetware.  Computers automate the process and humans provide the creative power.  Because quite frankly we are better at it.

(Investigate -> Ideate -> descope -> iterate)

Investigate 	- Gather data and intuition and define problems
Ideate 		    - Come up with ideas to solve the problems
Descope	      - Ruthlessly descope.  Don’t be afraid to go scorched earth.
Iterate		    - Execute what’s left over 
Repeat.       - start again

DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Dont do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective
in the agile sense.  But, for example, a deviation allows you to indroduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospective.

CONTRIBUTING

Contribute the way you would to any other open source project.  Raise a pull request.
