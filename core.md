## WHY KANBAN-ZAI

If you want to build scalable teams and enhance productivity and genuinely enrich the lives of everybody involved then Kanban-Zai is for you.

## CORE PRINCIPLES

* CONSENSUS   - Ensure everyone is one the same page.
* TRUST       - Which must be nurtured by stakeholders.
* FEEDBACK    - everyone needs it.  ALL the time. 
* DISCIPLINE  - Every one in the team must follow the collaborative process
* DEVIATIONS  - The one and only meeting Kanban-Zai enforces.  Run monthly, unless there is 100% consensus against it.

## GETTING STARTED

It is probbly not worth implementing any form of management process if you are 3 or less in a team, but if your team has outside influences in any form it's probably worth considering.

There are some core immutable principles your team need to take on-board, without which you are not doing Kanban-Zai.

  * VISIBILITY  - this is an important factor in trust, consenus and feedback.  However you communicate, what needs to be achieved should be visible to all team members.  There should be one source of truth for the work ahead.  This means no personal task lists.
  * OBJECTIVITY - Personal opinion does not matter.  A consensus of opinions does.
  * EVIDENCE    - There should be evidence compelling the team to start a peice of work and evidence to compel the team to cease that peice of work.
  * PRIORITY    - All things can be done as long as they are prioritized.  When deadlines are required priority defines what is descoped.
  * CONSISTENCY - 
  * RESPECT -
  * TEAM NORMS  - Your team's standard operational settings.

## CULTURE

It is important to create a work environment where those who want to grow, and are prepared to commit to it, are able to do so.  To that end there is no assumption of what the culture in any given team should or will be.  There are guidelines on how a teams culture can avoid colliding with the core principles of Kanban-Zai

* reinforce reliability as a cultural value, most reliability issues between people can be boiled down to poor communication, which is easily fixed
* Be ok with failure, do it often
* Be proactive about genuinley and generously giving credit to others
* Don't let blame blind you
* Don't wait to share bad news or ask for help
* Don't surprise people with decisions or problems out of the blue
* Dont surprise people, full stop.

## THE PROCESS

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.

(Investigate -> Ideate -> descope -> iterate)

* Investigate 	- Gather data and intuition and define problems
* Ideate 		    - Come up with ideas to solve the problems
* Descope	      - Ruthlessly descope.  Don’t be afraid to go scorched earth.
* Iterate		    - Execute what’s left over 
* Repeat.       - start again

## DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Dont do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective
in the agile sense.  But, for example, a deviation allows you to indroduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospective.
