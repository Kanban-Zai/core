WHAT IS KANBAN-ZAI

Kanban-Zai is a modern, people centric, flexible and extendable methodology for Software Development teams.  
A particular way of working is not enforced and the group of people involved are all encouraged to participate in extending your teams own subjective manifestation. 
The eventual manifestation, of KANBAN-ZAI will depend heavily on your teams collective interpretation of the following allegory.

“If Henry Ford listened to what his customers actually wanted we would all be driving around in 150 horsepower cars powered by 150 actual horses, and carbon emissions would be through the roof!”

## CORE IDEA

* CONSENSUS   - Ensure everyone is one the same page.
* TRUST       - Which must be nurtured by stakeholders.
* FEEDBACK    - everyone needs it.  ALL the time. 
* TEAM NORMS  - Your team's standard operational settings.
* DEVIATIONS  - The one and only meeting Kanban-Zai enforces.  Irregularly.  Use this to modify your settings.

## GETTING STARTED

It is probbly not worth implementing any form of management process if you are 3 or less in a team, but if your team has outside influences in any form it's probably worth considering.

There are some core immutable principles your team need to take on-board, without which you are not doing Kanban-Zai.

  * VISIBILITY  - this is an important factor in trust, consenus and feedback.  However you communicate, what needs to be achieved should be visible to all team members.  There should be one source of truth for the work ahead.  This means no personal task lists.
  * OBJECTIVITY - Personal opinion does not matter.  A consensus of opinions does.
  * EVIDENCE    - There should be evidence compelling the team to start a peice of work and evidence to compel the team to cease that peice of work.
  * PRIORITY    - All things can be done as long as they are prioritized.  When deadlines are required priority defines what is descoped.


THE PROCESS

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.

(Investigate -> Ideate -> descope -> iterate)

* Investigate 	- Gather data and intuition and define problems
* Ideate 		    - Come up with ideas to solve the problems
* Descope	      - Ruthlessly descope.  Don’t be afraid to go scorched earth.
* Iterate		    - Execute what’s left over 
* Repeat.       - start again

DEVIATIONS

A deviation is a formal method of changing settings.  Dont do it at any other time.  Keep it short and involve everybody.  A deviation is not a retrospective
in the agile sense.  But, for example, a deviation allows you to indroduce ( or remove ) a Team-Norm retrospective.

CONTRIBUTING

Contribute the way you would to any other open source project.  Raise a pull request.
