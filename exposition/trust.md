Kanban-Zai has Trust baked in from the beginning!
When people don’t trust you, it becomes obvious in their behaviour. They double-check your work, they micromanage you, and they don’t invite you to confidential meetings.

The Trust Equation  = (C+R+I) / SO

CREDIBILITY - has to do with the words we speak. In a sentence we might say, “I can trust what she says about intellectual property; she’s very credible on the subject.”

RELIABILITY - has to do with actions. We might say, “If he says he’ll deliver the product tomorrow, I trust him, because he’s dependable.”

INTIMACY- refers to the safety or security that we feel when entrusting someone with something. We might say, “I can trust her with that information; she’s never violated my confidentiality before, and she would never embarrass me.”

SELF-ORIENTATION - refers to the person’s focus. In particular, whether the person’s focus is primarily on him or herself, or on the other person. We might say, “I can’t trust him on this deal — I don’t think he cares enough about me, he’s focused on what he gets out of it.” Or more commonly, “I don’t trust him — I think he’s too concerned about how he’s appearing, so he’s not really paying attention.”  ( the antithesis of this is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick_Black_Theory)




APPENDIX E: THE TRUST EQUATION
Here’s an example scenario and how to use the trust equation:

I’ve just started working with Ted for the first time. After a few weeks, my impression of Ted is that he’s smart, well-informed, and punctual. However, I don’t know him that well, and he doesn’t seem to truly listen to others or take their ideas on board. Plus, he interrupts, a lot. 

Here’s how I would rate my trust in him (from 1-10):

Credibility = 8/10
Reliability = 7/10
Intimacy = 5/10
Self Orientation = 8/10

Trust = 8 + 7 + 5/ 8 = 2.5 (Note: the highest number you can get here is 30.)

Although I believe Ted knows his stuff, meets deadlines, and I think I can trust him with what I say, my overall trust in him is low. This is because he doesn’t take my ideas on board. He doesn’t even listen to them. His disregard for me means I’m not able to build emotional trust with him.

Now, let’s do a quick comparison with my long-standing colleague, Donna. She’s equally smart and well-informed, sometimes late with deadlines, keeps my sensitive information confidential, and is highly aware of others and their challenges.


 Here’s how I would rate her:
Credibility = 8
Reliability = 5
Intimacy = 7
Self Orientation = 2

Trust = 8 + 5 + 7/ 2 = 10

Even though Donna is sometimes late with deadlines, I trust her four times more than Ted. This is because Donna’s Self-Orientation is low. She listens to me. She seems to care. She’s self-aware and aware of others; their feelings, thoughts, and challenges.

After looking at this equation, it becomes clear that to build trust, you can increase Credibility,
Reliability, and Intimacy, and/or you can reduce Self-Orientation.  “Self-orientation, which sits alone in the denominator, is the most important variable in the Trust Equation.”

Thus, improving your Self Orientation (by reducing it) has the biggest influence on how much people can develop emotional trust with you. In the next section, we’ve got some pointers on how to do this.
