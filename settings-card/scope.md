# Scope

Scope Badges set the boundries of the work that can be done on any given card.  Another way to 
say this is how many other systems are you allowed to touch.  The word system is dependent on context.
If you are working at the function level then other functions are the system. At machine level other machines
are the system.

## limited

The work assigned to a card should be tightly constrained and the work to complete the card
 should be considered only do what is necessary and do no work that is not documented on the card.

Ostensibly this simplest thing to achieve the goal that makes a test pass.  This is stating explicitly that
only Test Driven Development projects should run with this setting.

Consider that developer scope is limited.  It this case the simplest thing is quite synonymous with 
"The least work right now", regardless of the technical debt this would undoubtedly create.

## constrained 

Work assigned to this type of card may address a larger scope than the previous setting.  Primarily this is where this 
card touches other parts of the system.  The team must define how far this is.

## Carte Blanche

The amount of work assigned to a Carte Blanche card should be similar to the previous setting but the 
developer has the permission to follow as many threads as needed to address the bigger picture.
