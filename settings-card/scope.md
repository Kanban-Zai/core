# D.O.D

Scope Badges set the boundries of the work that can be done on any given card.

## minimum

All cards are standard cards unless a badge has been deliberatley included on the card.  
The work assigned to a card should be tightly constrained and the work to complete the card
 should be considered only do what is necessary and do no work that is not documented on the card.

Ostensibly this simplest thing to achieve the goal is usually to make a test pass but as not all projects are TDD 
consider that developer scope is limited.  It this case the simplest this quite synonymous with 
"The least work right now", regardless of the technical debt this would undoubtedly create.

## Maintainable 

Work assigned to this type of card may address a larger scope than the previous setting.  Primarily this is where this 
card touches other parts of the system.

## Carte Blanche

The amount of work assigned to a Carte Blanche card should be similar to the previous setting but the 
developer has the permission to follow as many threads as needed to address the bigger picture.
