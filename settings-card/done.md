# When are you done?

The definition of done is about how technical debt is dealt with and defines the accepted approach the entire team 
will take with regards to managing technical debt on a per card basis, however the definition of done is ALWAYS 
superceded by the card scope setting.

In additon to choosing which setting to use your definition of done requires a description of what your team considers
technical debt.

# passive

Do not address technical debt.  Document only.

# Active

Address technical debt that work on this card produces.

# Aggressive

Address all technical debt you find within the scope of the card.  Bigger problems
should be documented but not modified unless Carte Blanche is granted.

Warning: under this setting cards will have long completion times.
