# Tech Debt Settings

Defines the accepted approach the entire team will take with regards to managing
technical debt, however the technical dept setting is ALWAYS superceded by the 
card scope setting.

# passive

Do not address technical debt.  Document only.

# Active

Address technical debt that work on this card produces, but do not look for
or address any tech debt outside the scope of the current card.

# Aggressive

Address all technical debt you find during the scope of the card.  Bigger problems
should be documented but not modified unless Carte Blanche is granted.

Warning: under this setting cards will have long completion times.
