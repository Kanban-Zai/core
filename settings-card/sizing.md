# Card sizing

Sizing is different on every team and changes over time.  Kanban-Zai recognises this
and does not impose a particular method of sizing work.  Choos the one the best suits.

However you must choose one of the following settings.

# granular

Generally cards will be broken down into small chunks

# balanced

Strike a balance 

# gross

This is most closley associated with Tee Shirt Sizing.
