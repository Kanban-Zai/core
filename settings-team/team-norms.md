## WHAT ARE TEAM NORMS?

These direct the day to day behaviour of your team.  They will likely be different for each and every team, although there could be common themes.

* Team norms as decided on by the team and changed via a deviation.  
* They define the operational boundaries of team culture ( no need for HR )
* New people coming in should be familiarised with them
* they should be splattered all over the walls so they can be pointed at by anyone at any time.  
* Overtime they define the team culture.

## REQUIRED KANBAN-ZAI TEAM NORMS

#### QUORUM OVERRIDES

To keep everything running with as little overhead as possible a quorum team members can override
all team and card settings except the team norms which maybe changed by running a deviation.

#### NO SURPRISES

The definition of surprise is an action taken or a decision made in the absence of evidence for such action or decision.
Don't do it.  You will be glad you listened.

## OPTIONAL TEAM NORMS AND EXTENDING KANBAN-ZAI

Team Norms are your path to making Kanban-Zai fit your team, and even change with the team and the times.
Here are a few that you can adopt when you first begin with Kanban-Zai.  Longer term they may not fit, but in the
beginning they will help a lot.

#### QUORUM

This is the minimum number of team members required to override general team business including card settings and team
settings but not including team norms.

#### BACKPORTING
In many cases cards are generally estimates (guesses) of what needs to be done.  You just dont know what you dont know 
sometimes.  However during the course of the work you may drop something, add something or change someting about the card.  
Record this change, split out new cards or combine existing ones.  
The goal of backporting is for the card to represent what was done rather than what was asked for.

#### SPEED LIMIT
Limit the amount of work in play at any one time.  It is to easy to get caught up in just pumping out work.  
By taking some time out you can save time in the future.

#### T-SHIRT SIZING
Approximate the size of each chunk of work, it helps long term.

#### BOY-SCOUT
Essentially boy scouting is clearing technical debt as a regular practice which anyone can do all the time.  
This is actually more dangerous and expensive than it sounds.

#### COWBOY
Under this setting members of the team are working fast and loose and generally leaving a wake of technical debt 
and everyone is ok with it.  This is a good way to start a project sometimes.  Ultimatley though the tech debt is 
going to weigh you down, but it stretches the costing model out months or years.

 
#### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
This is a very formal seting which requires all developers tho be disciplined.  It adds technical debt in the form of
 tests and in the form of code depending on your settings. 
 How this is implemented will have a very big impact on your team.


## Summary
Obviously this is going to require some negotiation with the team do keep your changes visible and get consensus.
